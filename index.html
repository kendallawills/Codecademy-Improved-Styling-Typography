            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <p>While typography has been practiced for many centuries, digital font design is a 
                relatively new discipline. There are some great examples of old-school fonts 
                (also called typefaces) which have been adapted for use on digital displays. However, 
                I would like to highlight a few of my favorite fonts that were created with screens 
                in mind.</p>
